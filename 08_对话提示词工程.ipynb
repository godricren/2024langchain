    "# How to use few shot examples in chat models\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide covers how to prompt a chat model with example inputs and outputs. Providing the model with a few such examples is called few-shotting, and is a simple yet powerful way to guide generation and in some cases drastically improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There does not appear to be solid consensus on how best to do few-shot prompting, and the optimal prompt compilation will likely vary by model. Because of this, we provide few-shot prompt templates like the FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate as a flexible starting point, and you can modify or replace them as you see fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of few-shot prompt templates are to dynamically select examples based  on an input, and then format the examples in a final prompt to provide for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The following code examples are for chat models only, since `FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplates` are designed to output formatted chat message rather than pure strings. For similar few-shot prompt examples for pure string templates compatible with completion models(LLMs), see the few-shot prompt templates guide."

    "## Fixed Examples\n",
    "The most basic(and common) few-shot prompting technique is to use fixed prompt examples. This way you can select a chain, evaluate it, and avoid worrying about additional moving parts in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic components of the template are:\n",
    "* `examples`: A list of dictionary examples to include the final prompt.\n",
    "* `example_prompt`: converts each example into 1 or more messages through its `format_messages` method. A common example would be to convert each example into one human message and one AI message response, or a human message followed by a function call message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple demonstration. First, define the examples you'd like to include. Let's give the LLM an unfamiliar mathematical operator, denoted by the \"$\" :"

However, \"2 $ 2\" would not be a valid expression in most languages.\\n\\n2. **Regular Expressions**: In regular expressions, the dollar sign is used to denote the end of a string.
