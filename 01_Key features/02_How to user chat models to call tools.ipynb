    "# How to use chat models to call tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool calling allows a chat model to respond to a given prompt by \"calling a tool\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, while the name \"tool calling\" implies that the model is directly performing some action, this is actually not the case! The model only generates the arguments to a tool, and actually running the tool(or not) is up to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool calling is a general technique that generates structured output from a model, and you can use it even when you don't intend to invoke any tools. An example use-case of that is extraction from unstructured text.\n",

    "![img1](../asset/tool_call.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain implements standard interface for defining tools, passing them to LLMs, and representing tool calls. This guide will cover how to bind tools to an LLM, then invoke the LLM to generate these arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining tool schemas\n",
    "\n",
    "For a model to be able to call tools, we need to pass in tool schemas that describe what the tool does and what it's arguments are. Chat models that support tool calling features implement a `.bind_tools()` method for passing tool schemas to the model. Tool schemas can be passed in as Python functions(with typehints and docstrings), Pydantic models, TypeDict classes, or LangChain Tool objects. Subsequent invocations of the model will pass in these tool schemas along with the prompt.\n",
